# Altnet 
Altnet is aimed to be a small scale network
simulator that one can run in a docker container.

The goal is to have a few thousand computers
and BBS hosts browsable in a telnet like environment.

It's in active development as of the beginning of
2023. I keep adding features whenever I have 
time to do that.
